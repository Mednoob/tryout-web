# Tryout Website
This is a simple tryout website, made by me. This was created for RISTEK Open Recruitment 2025.

## Requirements
- Node.js (v20 or later)
- PNPM
- Deno (v2.1 or later)
- A MongoDB database

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to `frontend` directory and run `pnpm install` to install the frontend dependencies
3. Go to each `frontend` and `backend` directory, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required fields
4. Run the backend server by running `deno task start` in the `backend` directory
5. Run the frontend server by running `pnpm dev` in the `frontend` directory

## Side Note
I know that the website is very clearly not finished. Sorry for that. I'm being rushed by the deadline :(
